<h1>The Best Movies According to Joshua</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Pearl Harbor</h3>
5/5 - Was the best WW2 movie I have watched. <br />

<p>
  Pearl Harbor (2001), directed by Michael Bay, is a historical war drama that
  blends romance and action against the backdrop of World War II. The film
  follows best friends Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh
  Hartnett), both pilots, as they navigate love, duty, and the devastating
  attack on Pearl Harbor. A central love triangle forms between Rafe, Danny, and
  Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), a nurse, adding an emotional depth to the narrative.
  The film’s cinematography is stunning, especially during the intense and
  realistic battle sequences. While the action and visuals are impressive, the
  film's historical accuracy and character development have been widely debated.
</p>

<p>
  Despite its breathtaking special effects, Pearl Harbor has received criticism
  for prioritizing romance over historical depth. Many viewers felt that the
  love story overshadowed the true tragedy and heroism of the event. The
  dialogue and pacing sometimes feel overly dramatic, making it more of a
  Hollywood spectacle than a serious war film. However, the emotional weight of
  the attack sequence and Hans Zimmer’s powerful score help elevate the film’s
  impact. Overall, Pearl Harbor delivers gripping action and heartfelt moments,
  but its mix of romance and war storytelling may not appeal to all audiences.

<h3>Toy Story 1-4</h3>
4.8 - Every release is a must watch. Still waiting for 5th installment
(Hopefully). <br />
<p>
  I watched the first Toy Story movie when I was a kid, during a time when I was
  sick with measles. I remember itching all over and feeling restless, so I
  stepped out of my room and turned on the TV. Since it was late at night, most
  of the channels were either showing news or drama series, which didn’t
  interest me. Then, I suddenly remembered that my mom had bought a Toy Story
  DVD. I played it, and as I got immersed in the movie, I completely forgot
  about the itching.
</p>

<p>
  Just thinking about that moment fills me with nostalgia. Now, as an adult, I
  find myself rewatching Toy Story from time to time. Every time I watch it, I
  feel like a kid again, taken back to those simple, carefree days. The movie
  remains special to me, not just because of its story, but because of the
  memories tied to it.

<h3>Bridge to Terabithia</h3>
4.5 - Worth the watch. Although I thought it was just gonna be a lighthearted
movie. <br />
<p>
  I first watched Bridge to Terabithia with my cousins, and I remember how much
  we were drawn into the story right from the start. The movie follows Jesse, a
  creative but lonely boy, and his friendship with Leslie, a new girl who
  introduces him to the magical world of Terabithia. Watching their adventures
  together made me appreciate the power of imagination, and the idea of creating
  your own world as an escape was something I found really captivating. The bond
  between Jesse and Leslie felt real, and it was easy to see how their
  friendship brought them comfort and strength in difficult times. The beautiful
  visuals of Terabithia and their imaginative kingdom made the movie even more
  enchanting.
</p>

<p>
  What really stuck with me, though, was how the film handled loss. Just when I
  thought the movie would remain a lighthearted fantasy, it took an emotional
  turn that I wasn’t expecting. It made me realize that the story was more than
  just about adventure – it was about how we cope with grief and how the people
  we love, even if they’re no longer with us, stay with us in our hearts. The
  performances by the cast, especially Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, were
  so genuine, which made the film’s emotional moments even more impactful.
  Bridge to Terabithia left me with a sense of nostalgia and a deeper
  appreciation for the bonds we form and the strength we find through
  imagination.
